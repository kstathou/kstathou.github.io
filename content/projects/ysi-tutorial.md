I did this tutorials at the YSI Complexity Economics conference that was attended mainly by PhD students and young scholars. I covered the following:

- Inspect an HTML page and identify which parts you want to scrape.
- Scrape web pages with requests and BeautifulSoup.
- Navigate Javascript elements with Selenium
- Judge when web scraping is the most suitable approach and what you should consider before doing so.
