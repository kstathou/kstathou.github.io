ArtificiaI intelligence (AI) techniques could play an important role in the mission to tackle COVID-19, from helping to discover new drugs and vaccines to predicting the spread of infection and testing patients. At the same time, many AI techniques are experimental, rely on big, sensitive datasets and might be difficult to apply in high-stakes domains such as health.

This report studies the levels, evolution, geography, knowledge base and quality of AI research in the COVID-19 mission field using a novel dataset taken from open preprints sites arXiv, bioRxiv and medRxiv, which we have enriched with geographical, topical and citation data.
