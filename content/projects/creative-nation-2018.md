Creative Nation uses official, open and web data to map the creative industries in the UK: their evolution, contribution to local economic development, the strength of their support ecosystems – including research and networking – and their connections with each other. The report presents eight key findings based on our analysis of the data, and is accompanied by an open dataset and interactive visualisations to help users explore the data.
